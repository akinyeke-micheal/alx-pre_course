## Introduction

Welcome to the ALX Software Engineering Pre-Course repository! My name is [Your Name], and I am currently enrolled in ALX Africa's Software Engineering program. I was originally part of Cohort 18 but have deferred to Cohort 22. This repository serves as an introductory section to my ALX journey, documenting the pre-course activities and preparations.

## Pre-Course Overview

### Why I Defered to Cohort 22

Life is a journey, and sometimes, unexpected changes occur. After initially being part of Cohort 18, I have deferred my enrollment to Cohort 22 to restragize my approach to the program and to apply all the insight gained while in cohort 18 to maximize from the program ,and what better way to do this than to start again from the very begining which is the foundation. I am excited to embrace this new opportunity to learn and grow as a software engineer.

### Goals for the Pre-Course

During this pre-course, I aim to:

- Review fundamental programming concepts
- Sharpen problem-solving skills
- Familiarize myself with ALX's learning environment
- Connect with fellow students and mentors
